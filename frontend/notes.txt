I want a frontend using FASTAPI

the frontend should display logs to the user

I want a checkbox of options users can click on to select Debug level (e.g. Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)

Once clicked I want the logs to show for the selected Data levels

I also want to add a timestamp check so it only shows logs within a certain time period
